1. Description
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple pong game. There are 2 modes for the Game.
1 player mode only has 1 racquet while the 2 players mode
will have 2 racquets and different controls. 
1 Player Mode
*The game will end if you won't be able to hit the ball
with your racquet. 
2 Players Mode
*The game will end if 1 player has a score of higher than the
other player by 3 points. When the ball wasn't hit by the
racquets, it will open a dialog box saying "Game Over" but 
the game will still continue.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2.How to Play
-----------------------------------------------------------
When you run the program, a dialog box will appear.
Choose which mode you want to play. Choose 1Player mode if
you want to play alone. Choose 2Players mode if you want
to play with another person.

----------------------------------------------------------
3.Control
----------------------------------------------------------
1Player mode
<- Left key = moves the racquet to the left
-> Right key = moves the racquet to the right

2Players mode
W key = moves the racquet of Player 1 upwards
S key = moves the racquet of Player 1 downwards

UP key = moves the racquet of Player 2 upwards
Down Key = moves the racquet of PLayer 2 downwards

Note: There are special moves for 2players mode
R key = increases the speed of the ball when it collides 
with the player 1's racquet

SHIFT key = increases the speed of the ball when it collides
with the player 2's racquet

4.Dialog Messages - what do they mean and what should I do??
-------------------------------------------------------------

When a gameover dialog appears, just press okay or Enter key
the game will continue afterwards.

if a "Do you want to Restart the Game?" dialog appears
if you choose yes, the game will restart but only to the current
mode. For example, if you chose 1Player mode, and you will be asked
if you want to restart the game, the game will restart but it
will restart to the player 1 mode. Same as 2Players mode.
if you chose 2Players mode from the start, if you restart the game
the game will restart but to the 2Players mode.
